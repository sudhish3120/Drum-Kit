# Drum-Kit
The Drum-kit is a website with a number of buttons that represent different parts of a drum set. When a button is pressed, the corresponding sound of the drum will be played. 
The drum set reacts to both mouse-clicks and keyboard events. This website was made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
